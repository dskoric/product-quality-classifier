# Regularized Logistic Regression

This project implements regularized logistic regression to predict whether lithium-ion batteries from a fabrication plant pass quality assurance (QA) based on two test results.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to build a logistic regression model that can determine whether batteries should be accepted or rejected based on their test results. The model uses feature mapping to create a non-linear decision boundary and regularization to prevent overfitting.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python src/main.py`

## Results

The model achieves approximately 82% accuracy on the training set.
